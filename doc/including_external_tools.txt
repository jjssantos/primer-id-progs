# intersectBed genomeCoverageBed bamToBed
Ported to another system and they work as long as bedtools is in the same directory. These are just 2-line shell scripts that call bedtools. e.g., 
cat pid_tools/intersectBed 
	#!/bin/sh
	${0%/*}/bedtools intersect "$@"
Probably not necessary to include these... make sure that I call the full command in my scripts "bedtools intersect", etc.
