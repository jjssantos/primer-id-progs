	# This works on Helix.

# samtools, bcftools, seqtk, vcfutils.pl
All of these can be ported to another system (Helix) and work (shows usage)
I can remove samtools 0.1.18

# Btrim64

# intersectBed genomeCoverageBed bamToBed
Ported to Helix and they work as long as bedtools is in the same directory. These are just 2-line shell scripts that call bedtools. e.g., 
cat pid_tools/intersectBed 
	#!/bin/sh
	${0%/*}/bedtools intersect "$@"
Probably not necessary to include these... make sure that I call the full command in my scripts "bedtools intersect", etc.

# bam2fastx

# picard.jar

I can remove SortSam jar file. * Make sure the command in the script is using picard.jar.

# PANDAseq
Not portable.  Need to recompile static version.

# mgqce
Haven't included in the repo.  Low priority.
